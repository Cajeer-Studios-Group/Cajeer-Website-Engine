## Description
**Cajeer Website Engine** (abbr. **CWE**) is an open source content management system (Open-source CMS) developed by the Russian studio "Cajeer 404" (formerly "Cajeer Web") by order of the Russian studio "Cajeer Software" (formerly " Cajeer Developers). The system is written in PHP and uses MySQL as a database. The development was started in 2018, but from 2018 to 2021 the system was commercial, and starting from 2022 the system was completely rewritten by new authors and received the status of an open system, and therefore the 2022 version can rightly be considered the third version of the system. The system is positioned by its publisher as a tool for creating any kind of websites. The main languages of the system are English, Spanish, Russian and French, there are also German and Italian localizations.

## About the project
**Cajeer Engine Kit** (abbr. **CEK**) are content management systems that were developed by the Cajeer Russian team to make it easier for the team to create custom web resources. The systems are written in the PHP programming language and use MySQL as a database for simple administration and for further editing by the customer of the finished product. The development was started in 2014, but from 2014 to 2018 the systems were closed and distributed individually by order of clients, and starting from 2018 they were completely transferred to the Russian studio Cajeer Web and received the status of commercial content management systems.

The creation of a CMS Kit was proposed by SkiF4er for the convenience of creating web resources by Cajeer Team programmers, its easy further management and modification by the customer, as well as for the quick execution of orders based on this CMS Kit, which further led the Cajeer Team to increase orders for web resources based on this CMS Kit. CMS Kit became the hallmark of any development from the Cajeer Team and prophesied a good future for them, but like any CMS Kit it needed to be developed constantly and with high quality, which led to its closure due to the irrelevance of the original components of the CMS Kit and its transfer to Cajeer Web, the last benefited from the further development of the CMS Kit and maintaining it on the CMS Kit market, but Cajeer Web decided to change the license and the principle of its distribution due to Cajeer Web's disinterest in distributing the CMS Kit in a closed form by order and changed it to a commercial form of distribution. Only the structure of the CMS Kit remained unchanged due to its main rule: "Convenience and simplicity are the guarantee of the success of the CMS Kit."
